# Ag-AI
Capstone Project

The goal of this project is to build trust in farmers on the idea of artificial intelligence. We plan to do this by allowing the user to interact with an active learning system, providing information to a machine learning algorithm and seeing how their input changes the accuracy of the algorithm. This information can be saved by a user and then analyzed to provide in-depth analytics of user and machine labeled images.

The develop branch is used to run this project. Images folder is used to hold all images. Images must be separated by classification by adding a folder that holds all images of the classification. There must be a path to each file in master to run this program.

The user will interact with a web-based user interface, where theyâ€™ll be asked to label pictures of corn as either healthy or unhealthy.
